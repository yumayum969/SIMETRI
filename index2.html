                    <p>I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack development 
                        (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual 
                        aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing 
                        clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.

                        I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow and
                        evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. 
                        Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, 
                        I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, 
                        TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
